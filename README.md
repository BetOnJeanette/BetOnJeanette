# Hello! 
I'm Jeanette Crull, a full-stack developer based in Michigan! 

# What am I up to?
- Right now, I'm in a combo of workin on Advent of Code 2024 (though that is going a *liiittle* slowly.)
- Beyond that, I am working on a digital board game in Godot.
- Outside of code, I (very occasionally) make videos. Some of them are challenge videos, some of them are soda reviews. [Check 'em out here](https://www.youtube.com/@zamo312)

# What have I done recently?
- I made a tool that plans the routing for carpooling.
- I made a video of me playing through a [Helldivers 2 drinking game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZo3l7KVhvE).
